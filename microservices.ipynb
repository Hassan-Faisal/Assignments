    "Ans: Microservices are a way to build software applications as a collection of small, independent services. Each service performs a specific task and can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. They communicate with each other using APIs, allowing for flexibility and scalability. This approach enables faster development and deployment, as individual services can be updated without affecting the entire application. Microservices promote autonomy, innovation, and the use of diverse technologies. They allow developers to choose the best tools for each service, resulting in more agile and resilient applications. This architecture enables organizations to build complex systems that are easier to maintain and evolve.\n"
